# v19 (cs16-amxx-android): minimal libffcall-compatible trampoline library
# for Android ARM. GNU libffcall has no aarch64 backend and its arm32
# backend needs anonymous RWX memory (blocked on Android 10+ for apps
# targeting API 29+), so hamsandwich could never load there.
#
# This is a drop-in replacement exposing the two entry points hamsandwich
# uses: alloc_trampoline() / free_trampoline(). It generates a tiny
# "store hook pointer; tail-jump to callback" thunk in native ARM machine
# code and allocates it through a W^X-safe path (memfd-backed RX mapping
# when anonymous RWX is denied).
